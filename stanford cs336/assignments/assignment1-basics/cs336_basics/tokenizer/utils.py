) -> list[int]:
    """
    The find_chunk_boundaries function works as follows:

    1. INITIALIZATION:
    - Calculates total file size in bytes
    - Divides file size by desired_num_chunks to get approximate chunk_size
    - Creates initial boundary guesses at uniform intervals

    2. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT:
    - For each internal boundary (not start/end):
        a. Seeks to the initial boundary position
        b. Reads mini-chunks of 4096 bytes
        c. Searches for the split_special_token in each mini-chunk
        d. When found, adjusts boundary to that exact position
        e. If EOF reached, sets boundary to file end

    3. FINAL PROCESSING:
    - Removes duplicate boundaries (sorted(set()))
    - Returns list of unique boundary positions

    KEY FEATURES:
    - Ensures chunks split at semantic boundaries (e.g., line breaks)
    - Prevents breaking tokens/words in the middle
    - Handles edge cases like small files or many requested chunks
    - Efficient: reads in 4KB chunks rather than entire file

    USE CASES:
    - Parallel text processing (each worker handles one chunk)
    - Tokenization of large corpora
    - Log file analysis
    - Distributed data processing
